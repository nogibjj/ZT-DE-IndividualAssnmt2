# Rust CLI Binary with SQLite
A simple command-line interface application built with Rust, integrating SQLite for database operations.

## Features
- Rust syntax and unique features demonstration.
- CRUD operations using SQLite database.
- Optimized Rust Binary generation via GitHub Actions.

## Usage
To run the program, use the following command:
'cargo run'

## Dependencies
- Rust Programming Language: Installation Guide <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>
- SQLite: Included as part of the Rust project dependencies.

## GitHub Copilot
During the development process, I utilized GitHub Copilot, an AI programming assistant. Copilot provided suggestions, helped write functions such as 'filter_vector()', and ensured efficient coding practices. The introduction of Copilot to this project greatly enhanced the development speed and provided valuable insights.
